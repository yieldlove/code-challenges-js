## Goal

Read and learn the documents about header bidding mentioned in the references section. 
Implement the following challenges **as best as you can**.
Please keep your codes and environments. It would be nice to review your pages and codes in the interview.



## Challenges


### Challenge A

Implement an HTML page to display **an ad with Prebid.js and googletag** integrated based on the **Basic Prebid.js Example** of Prebid.js.
The ad should have a width of 728px and a height of 90px.

Here is the expected output:

### Challenge B

On top of **Challenge A**, implement another ad in a DIV with an ID of "div-2",
the ad should be delivered from the provided bid server simulator.

The ad should have a width of 300px and a height of 250px.


The expected solution should look similar to the following image:

Here are additional resources for this challenge:


#### Endpoint

The entry of the bid server is located at `./bid-server/server.js`. It exposes two endpoints:

| Endpoint       | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| `/static`      | To make static html pages accessible via the bid server |
| `/bids`        | To receive bid requests from the yieldloveBidAdapter in Prebid.js and response bids |

It is required to map [test.yieldlove.com:20457](http://test.yieldlove.com:20457) to your localhost.
The endpoints must be accessible via the domain [test.yieldlove.com:20457](http://test.yieldlove.com:20457).
This can be accomplished by modifying your hosts file.

The cpm in the responded bid is generated randomly.


#### Prebid.js Build

Build Prebid.js locally and use the built Prebid.js to display ads.
A locally built Prebid.js with the provided `yieldloveBidAdapter.js` must be placed in the `resources` folder.

Please refer to **Build Prebid.js locally for tests** in the References section for more information.


#### Yieldlove bid adapter

Add the Yieldlove bid adapter into your local build. The provided `yieldloveBidAdapter.js` needs to be placed in the `modules` folder of prebid.

The HTML page to display ads should be accessible via [test.yieldlove.com:20457/static](http://test.yieldlove.com:20457/static).

The ad unit code (ad unit path) displayed in the 'div-2' should be `/53015287/yieldlove.com_hb_test_300x250_2`

The Bid Adapter configuration looks like the following:

```
[
  {
    bidder: 'yieldlove',
    params: {
      placementId: 40882157810
    }
  }
]
```


#### Debug

It's recommended to turn on Prebid.js debug messages on console to debug. Check more details here:
https://docs.prebid.org/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-guide.html#turn-on-prebidjs-debug-messages



### Challenge C

Based on **Challange B**. Set a customized targeting key for the GPT slot for `/53015287/yieldlove.com_hb_test_300x250_2` based on received bids.

Call `googletag.Slot.setTargeting` to set targeting keys for a specified ad slot.

Refer to the Google Tag API for more inforamtion. The `Slot.setTargeting` must be called before invoking `googletag.pubads().refresh()`

| Key            | Value | Description |
| -------------- | ----- | ----------- |
| `yieldlove_hb_pb` | A rounded number with two decimal places from the CPM of the winning bid | The rule to round is:<br> - if the CPM < 20, rounded to 2 decimal<br> - if the CPM â‰¥ 20 and < 60, rounded to 2 decimal with step of each 0.05 euro<br><br>For Example:<br>- If the CPM is 0.5213124, the value should be `0.52`<br> - If the CPM is 21.21456, the value should be `21.25`<br> - If the CPM is 22.266, the value should be `22.30` |
| `yieldlove_hb_adid` | The ad identifier of the received bid | The `bidResponse.adId` property |
| `yieldlove_hb_placement` | The placement identifier | A constant value of `9859` |



### Challenge D

Implement the ad of **Challenge B - "div-2"** with Prebid.js as the only SSP (ad partner).
Refrain from using the googletag library.



### Challenge E

Implement another page to display the same ads based on **Challenge B** with one of the following frameworks:
 - Vuejs
 - React
 - Angular
